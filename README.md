# Artificial-Horizon-Display
A simple system where an Arduino uses an MPU6050 to measure roll and pitch and then sends those values to my laptop through a serial port. A java program that I wrote can then read these values, and use them to make a live Artificial horizon graphic, that is similar to the real deal found on planes.
